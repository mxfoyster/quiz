# quiz

## The Idea 
A simple component that can be used to build a quiz on a website. This will mostly be HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. I might use a bit of PHP here and there.

## The Container
I intend to use my popup code from my componentlibrary1 repo to run the quiz within. In this way, it can be accessed from within an existing website with minimal impact to the page itself, popping up as an optional feature.
